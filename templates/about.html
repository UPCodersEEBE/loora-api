    <h4 class="card-title">How does it work? </h4>
    <p class="card-text">Loora's ultrasonic device connects to your community's open LoRa gateway, and sends a message every time it detects movement. Our back-end will check how long ago was movment last detected, and if it has been too long, it will send a Whattsapp through the Twilio API to the carer, so they can take adequate action.</p>
