      Loora is an open-source, low cost and minimal connectivity teleassistace
      project for the elderly and disables. Loora integrates an ultrasonic
      sensor device that traks movement in the home of your loved ones, if
      movement isn't detected for a while it will alert you on your phone so you
      can take adequate actions.

    <h4 class="card-title">How does it work?</h4>
    <hr />
    <p class="card-text">
      Loora's ultrasonic device connects to your community's open LoRa gateway,
      and sends a message every time it detects movement. Our back-end will
      check how long ago was movment last detected, and if it has been too long,
      it will send a Whattsapp through the Twilio API to the carer, so they can
      take adequate action.
